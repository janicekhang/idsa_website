				We set up company talks which provides students with direct and unique interactions with professionals from industrial design centered companies and organizations. The most recent of these talks was with Puma apparel and footwear designers. For this event, we were joined by two RISD ID alumni: Lauren Arthur ‘06 and Jacob Garcia ‘12 who currently design major products at Puma. They shared their personal sights about life at Puma, their design process, key career tips, and a sneak peak at work-in-progress designs (making it a strictly no-photos event!). Through this process, students were able to get a sneak-peek into the every-day details of being a designer at Puma which usually remain unseen.</p>
